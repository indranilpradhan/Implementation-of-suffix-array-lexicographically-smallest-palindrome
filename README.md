# Implementation-of-suffix-array-lexicographically-smallest-palindrome

Implement a Suffix Array that is capable of performing following operations on Strings in a
most efficient way.

Given a strings S determine its longest substring that is also a palindrome. In the
case of multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest palindrome.
